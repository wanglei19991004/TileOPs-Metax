INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE AGENT (do not copy into the PR body).

Layout principle: one section per op, one table per section, TileOPs and
baseline side-by-side on the same row so readers can compare without
mentally joining two tables.

Filling in the template below:

- One row per measurement (shape × dtype) within an op's table.
- Baseline column header names the baseline (`torch (ms)`, `FA3 (ms)`,
  `triton (ms)`). Don't write a generic "Baseline". Multiple baselines →
  add more columns and more Speedup columns (`vs torch`, `vs FA3`).
- Speedup is always present — it's the first number readers look for.
  Format `4.96×`, two decimals, computed as baseline_ms / tileops_ms.
- Throughput column: show ONE — TFLOPS for compute-bound ops (matmul,
  attention), BW (TB/s) for memory-bound ops (reductions, elementwise,
  norms). Pure data movement → BW only. Don't list both.
- Show throughput for TileOPs only; baseline's absolute throughput is
  noise once Speedup is given.
- Drop the Shape column if the op only varies dtype; in that case put
  the fixed shape in the section header (e.g. `### {OpName} (4096, 4096)`)
  so the benchmark's scale stays visible. Never put autotune config
  (`block_m`, `threads`) in the table — implementation detail.
- **Preserve the original shape tuple — never flatten to a single
  element count.** Write `(4096, 4096)` for a 2D input, `(2, 4096, 128)`
  for a 3D one, and `(4194304,)` (or `(4M,)`) for a genuinely 1D op.
  A bare `4M` loses dimensionality: readers can't tell `(4M,)` from
  `(2K, 2K)` from `(64, 64K)`, yet those have very different access
  patterns. Use `K`/`M` only inside a tuple to keep large numbers
  readable, never to replace it.
- Environment block goes once at the top, not per op.
- Takeaways = conclusions, not data repetition. Wins, losses with a brief
  reason (not blocking), dtype/shape patterns.

Bench-file authoring rules (apply when writing benchmarks/ops/*.py, NOT
copied into the PR body):

- All dtypes in `SUPPORTED_DTYPES`; ≥3 shapes per op, include non-pow2
  if supported.
- Shapes must map to real model geometry. Default LLaMA sizes:
  hidden ∈ {4096, 5120, 8192}, intermediate ∈ {10240, 11008, 14336,
  20480, 28672}, seq_len ∈ {2048, 4096}.
- Every benchmark must record at least one baseline. Tags: `tileops`
  (TileOPs implementation; required exactly once per config; variants
  like `tileops-lut` also count) and `torch` / `FA3` / `fla` / `triton`
  (baselines for comparison). External baselines may be conditional,
  but the else branch must fall back to torch — never silently skip.
- `BenchmarkReport.record()` first arg must be the Op object, never a
  string literal.

## Benchmark

**Environment**: \{GPU}, CUDA \{ver}, PyTorch \{ver}, TileLang \{ver}

### \{OpName}

| Shape | dtype | TileOPs (ms) | \{baseline} (ms) | Speedup | BW (TB/s) |
| ----- | ----- | ------------ | ---------------- | ------- | --------- |

<!-- Repeat one ### section per op. Drop the Shape column if the op only
varies dtype. Swap `BW (TB/s)` for `TFLOPS` on compute-bound ops.
Shape values are tuples: `(4096, 4096)`, `(2, 4096, 128)`, `(4M,)`. -->
