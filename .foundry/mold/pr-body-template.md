<!--
KEEP IT SHORT. Reviewers read PRs to learn WHAT changed and HOW to verify it.
- Summary: 3–5 bullets, one line each. No prose paragraphs.
- Do NOT recount the development process (reviewer rounds, follow-up issues filed,
  prior commits reverted, design rationale that already lives in the linked issue).
- Do NOT restate the linked issue's motivation; "Closes #N" already links it.
- One short paragraph of cross-cutting context is fine when bullets can't carry it.
- If a section doesn't apply, delete the header — never leave empty sections.
