"""Argmin op: returns int64 indices of the minimum along a given dim.

The Op layer validates inputs, reshapes to 2D (M, N), pads to alignment,
calls the kernel, and reshapes the output back. Output dtype is always int64.
Kernels are cached by ``(M, N)`` so the same op instance handles varying shapes.
