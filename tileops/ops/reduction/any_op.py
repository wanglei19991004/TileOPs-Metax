"""AnyFwdOp: returns bool indicating if any element is non-zero along ``dim``.

The Op layer validates inputs, normalizes ``dim``, reshapes to 2D (M, N),
calls the kernel, and reshapes the output back.  Alignment padding is handled
inside the kernel with 0, which is neutral for OR/any.  Output dtype is always
bool.

Supports any numeric dtype as input including torch.bool, int32, int64, and
complex types. Inputs with unsupported TileLang storage dtypes (bool, int32,
int64, complex64, complex128) are pre-converted to float32 before the kernel
call.

Kernels are cached by ``(M, N)`` so that the same op instance can handle
varying shapes.
