"""CountNonzeroFwdOp: counts non-zero elements along ``dim``, returning int64.

The Op layer validates inputs, normalizes ``dim``, reshapes to 2D (M, N),
calls the kernel, and reshapes the output back.  Alignment padding is handled
inside the kernel with 0, which is neutral for sum/count.  Output dtype is
always int64.

Supports any numeric dtype as input including torch.bool, int32, int64, and
complex types. Inputs with unsupported TileLang storage dtypes (bool, int32,
int64, complex64, complex128) are pre-converted to float32 before the kernel
call.

Kernels are cached by ``(M, N)`` so that the same op instance can handle
varying shapes.

Note: Unlike AllFwdOp/AnyFwdOp, CountNonzeroFwdOp does NOT accept ``keepdim``.
The reduction dimension is always removed, matching ``torch.count_nonzero``.
