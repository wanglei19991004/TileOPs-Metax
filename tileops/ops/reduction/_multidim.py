"""Multi-dim reduction utilities for the Op layer.

Provides helpers to flatten multiple reduction dims into a single dim,
so that existing single-dim kernels can handle ``dim=list[int]`` by
reducing over the flattened dimension.

Strategy: move all target dims to the end, flatten them into one dim,
reduce along that single dim, then restore the output shape with or
without keepdim.
