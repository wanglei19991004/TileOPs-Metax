"""Shared shape-rule helpers for reduction-style ops.

Concrete `shape_rules` expressions for the reduction family follow a
recurring pattern: validate the requested reduction dimension against
the input rank, normalize negatives via modulo, and (for sequence-valued
``dim``) enforce uniqueness of the normalized indices. Pasting Python
expressions into every manifest entry duplicates the contract and lets
the wording drift between ops.

This module exposes those patterns as named, individually testable
predicates and value extractors. Each is registered by name into the
validator's shape_rule builtin set (``scripts/validate_manifest.py``)
alongside the broadcasting helpers (``broadcast_shapes`` etc.) and the
Python primitives (``len``, ``range``, …), so a manifest entry can call
them by bare name::

    shape_rules:
      - "dim_range_validity(x, dim)"
      - "dim_uniqueness(x, dim)"
      - "output.ndim == x.ndim - len(reduced_axes(x, dim))"

Inline-string rules continue to work unchanged so ops can migrate one
at a time.

Helper semantics intentionally mirror the inline reduction expressions
that previously lived in the manifest, so a malformed ``dim`` (e.g. a
list whose elements are not ints) propagates the same ``TypeError`` the
inline expression would have raised. The validator already classifies
such eval errors as warnings (the rule is treated as un-evaluatable
under mock inputs and the parity check is skipped), so behavioural
parity with the pre-migration manifest is preserved end-to-end.

    Mirrors the inline reduction-dim expression

    short-circuits to True (callers fall back to "all axes"); a single
    int wraps into a one-element list before the bounds check; any other
    value is iterated directly. Non-iterable values, or sequences whose
    elements cannot be compared to ``int``, propagate the same exception

def reduced_axes(x: Any, dim: Any) -> frozenset:
    """Return the set of normalized axis indices reduced over.

    Mirrors the structure of the inline reduction-axes expression
    ``{dim % x.ndim} if isinstance(dim, int) else
    {d % x.ndim for d in dim} if isinstance(dim, (list, tuple)) and
    len(dim) > 0 else set(range(x.ndim))``. The branch selection and
    per-element computation are identical; the only intentional change
    is the return type — every branch returns ``frozenset`` rather than
    ``set`` for immutability. Python treats ``frozenset == set`` of the
    same elements as equal, so manifest expressions that compare via
    ``==`` or use the result inside ``len(...)`` / ``in`` see no
    behaviour change.

    ``isinstance(dim, int)`` accepts ``bool`` too (bool subclasses int);
    that quirk is intentional parity. A list/tuple with elements that
    cannot be reduced modulo an int propagates the same exception the
    inline form would raise — the validator classifies that as an eval
    error and surfaces it as a warning (parity check skipped). Anything
    else (``None``, a set, a string, etc.) falls through to the "all
    axes" branch, matching the inline expression's else clause.

    Pair this helper with :func:`dim_range_validity` and
    :func:`dim_uniqueness` so range / uniqueness violations surface
    before the output-shape rules consult :func:`reduced_axes`.

    Args:
        x: A tensor-like object exposing ``.ndim``.
        dim: An int, ``None``, or a list/tuple of ints.

    Returns:
        A ``frozenset`` of normalized axis indices. The typical case
        returns ``frozenset[int]`` with members in ``[0, x.ndim)``; the
        return type is intentionally left unparameterised because
        malformed list/tuple elements pass through ``d % x.ndim`` and
        whatever that operation produces (e.g. ``float`` for ``1.5``)
        appears verbatim in the result. The helper preserves inline
        semantics, so callers that supply non-int sequence elements get
        the same return as the pre-migration inline expression.

    Raises:
        TypeError: For a list/tuple whose elements cannot be reduced
            modulo ``x.ndim``; the validator handles this as a warning,
