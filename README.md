## Overview

TileOPs is a GPU operator library for LLM training and inference, built on [TileLang](https://github.com/tile-ai/tilelang). Beyond providing a growing collection of production-quality operators, TileOPs explores a **spec-driven development model** where AI agents can read declarative operator specifications, generate kernel implementations, and evaluate them against hardware-theoretical performance bounds — with minimal human scaffolding.

### Architecture

Every operator is split into two layers with a strict boundary:

- **Op** (L2) — stateless Python entry point. Handles validation, dtype casting, and memory layout. Compatible with CUDA-Graph and `torch.compile`.
- **Kernel** (L1) — TileLang GPU implementation with hardware-specific optimizations (Ampere, Hopper).

This separation keeps user-facing behavior independent of GPU strategy, allowing agents and developers to modify either layer without side effects on the other.

### Key Properties

- **Spec-driven** — each operator is declared in a machine-readable manifest (`tileops/manifest/`) that specifies signatures, workloads, and roofline formulas, serving as the entry point for both agent code generation and automated validation
- **Roofline-evaluated** — kernel performance is measured against Speed-of-Light hardware bounds, not relative baselines
- **Auto-tuning** — built-in search over tile sizes, pipelines, and scheduling parameters
- **Lightweight** — depends only on TileLang, PyTorch, and einops

## Installation

TileOPs can be installed from PyPI or built from source. A CUDA-capable GPU is required.

### Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.10
- PyTorch >= 2.1
- CUDA Toolkit
- NVIDIA GPU: **Hopper** (SM_90)
- [TileLang](https://github.com/tile-ai/tilelang) == 0.1.9

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install tileops
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tile-ai/TileOPs
cd TileOPs
make install    # dev dependencies + pre-commit hooks
```

> [!NOTE]
> If CUDA and TileLang are already installed system-wide and you encounter build issues:
> `PIP_NO_BUILD_ISOLATION=1 pip install -e '.[dev]' -v && pre-commit install`

Verify:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -q    # requires a CUDA GPU
```

## Quick Start

```python
import torch
from tileops.ops import GemmOp

M, N, K = 1024, 1024, 512
dtype = torch.float16

gemm = GemmOp(M, N, K, dtype=dtype)

A = torch.randn(M, K, device="cuda", dtype=dtype)
B = torch.randn(K, N, device="cuda", dtype=dtype)

C = gemm(A, B)
```
