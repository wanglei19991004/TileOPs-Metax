name: bench-op
description: Fix benchmark file to work with the new Op interface. Run benchmark, fix errors, repeat until it produces numbers.
---

## Arguments

`op_name`, `source_bench`, `source_op` — passed by align-family orchestrator.

## Contract

- **Input**: `op_name`, `source_bench`, `source_op`
- **Output**: updated benchmark file + commit
- **Termination (success)**: benchmark runs to completion, produces numeric output (latency/TFLOPS/bandwidth)
- **Termination (blocked)**: failure is not interface-related (e.g., kernel bug). Return `blocked` with reason.
- **Constraint**: must NOT modify Op implementation or tests. Benchmark-only changes.
- **Environment**: local GPU required.

## Workflow

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> RUN_BENCH
    RUN_BENCH --> DONE: benchmark produces numbers
    RUN_BENCH --> FIX_ERROR: runtime error
    FIX_ERROR --> RUN_BENCH: benchmark code fixed
    FIX_ERROR --> BLOCKED: error is not interface-related
    BLOCKED --> [*]: return blocked to orchestrator
    DONE --> COMMIT
    COMMIT --> [*]
```

## Steps

### 1. RUN_BENCH

Execute the benchmark file:

```bash
python -m pytest <source_bench> -v
```

If it runs and produces numbers → DONE.

### 2. FIX_ERROR

Read the traceback. The error is the signal — typically the benchmark constructs the Op with the old interface (e.g., `Op(M, N, dtype)` instead of `Op(dim, dtype)`).

Fix the benchmark construction code to use the new Op interface. This is interactive — fix what breaks, don't predict errors in advance.

If the error is NOT about interface mismatch (e.g., kernel crash, CUDA error) → BLOCKED.

### 3. COMMIT

Commit benchmark changes only. Follow `docs/design/testing.md` benchmark requirements.
