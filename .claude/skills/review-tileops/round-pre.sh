# round-pre.sh — pre-codex hook for the review loop.
#
# Implements Rule 1 (same-SHA APPROVE skip): if any prior round in
# this loop run already produced an APPROVE on the *current* HEAD
# sha, skip the codex invocation entirely. Reuse the prior APPROVE
# verbatim by writing a marker round-NN.json that carries the same
# codex_event/blockers as the prior round and points back at it
# via the "approve_reused_from" field.
#
# Inputs (env or positional, env wins):
#   RUN_DIR           — review/ root for this loop run; must contain rounds/.
#   NEXT_ROUND        — integer round number about to run (e.g. 5).
#   HEAD_SHA          — full git sha of the PR HEAD this round would review.
#   LATEST_ISSUE_ID   — current max id of any non-reviewer top-level PR
#                       (issue) comment.
#   LATEST_REVIEW_ID  — current max id of any non-reviewer review/inline
#                       comment (incl. thread replies).
#                       Each is independent. When supplied, the reuse
#                       decision requires the prior approving round's
#                       counterpart watermark to match. A caller may
#                       supply only one — the unsupplied dimension is
#                       not constrained. If a NEW human comment of
#                       either kind landed on the same SHA after the
#                       prior APPROVE, the matched watermark mismatches
#                       and this hook returns "proceed" so codex re-
#                       reviews and ingests the comment. When BOTH are
#                       absent or empty, the watermark guard is skipped
#                       entirely (legacy behavior, used by tests that
#                       pre-date the watermark fields).
#
# Positional fallback:
#   round-pre.sh <RUN_DIR> <NEXT_ROUND> <HEAD_SHA> [LATEST_ISSUE_ID] [LATEST_REVIEW_ID]
#
# Output:
#   - exit 0 + stdout "skip"     → loop should skip codex; round-NN.json is
#                                  already written by this script.
#   - exit 0 + stdout "proceed"  → no prior APPROVE on this SHA, OR a
#                                  recoverable condition was hit (missing
#                                  args, missing rounds dir, malformed
#                                  prior round file, etc.). The loop's
#                                  ``|| echo "proceed"`` fallback expects
#                                  this contract: round-pre.sh is a
#                                  monitor and MUST NOT exit non-zero on
#                                  recoverable conditions, otherwise
#                                  corrupt state would be silently
#                                  re-mapped to "proceed" and could
#                                  re-enable a same-SHA re-review.
#   - non-zero exit              → reserved for truly unexpected errors
#                                  (e.g. jq missing). Currently unused.
#
# Determinism: pure file scan. No gh / git / network. No LLM.

# Scan prior round-*.json files for an APPROVE on the same head_sha_after.
# Pure jq filter; oldest-first sort iterates rounds chronologically.
#
# Selection contract: when LATEST_ISSUE_ID and/or LATEST_REVIEW_ID are
# provided, we MUST iterate ALL same-SHA APPROVE candidates and reuse
# the one whose recorded watermarks match every supplied LATEST_*_ID
# (per-dimension; unsupplied dimensions are unconstrained). Breaking
# on the first SHA match would cause this failure mode:
#
#   round 5: APPROVE on sha=X, issue_wm=100, review_wm=50
#   <human comments land; watermarks → 200, 60>
#   round 6: re-APPROVE on sha=X, issue_wm=200, review_wm=60
#   round 7: must skip, but old code found round 5 first, saw stale
#            watermark=100 != 200, returned "proceed" — re-running codex
#            even though round 6 is a perfectly reusable APPROVE.
#
# So: keep scanning. Each watermark dimension is independent — only the
# LATEST_*_ID values the caller actually supplied are required to match;
# unsupplied dimensions are unconstrained. If no watermarks are supplied
# (or no prior round recorded them) fall back to legacy SHA-only reuse
# using the earliest APPROVE.
