"""Structural tests for the gpu-smoke / runner-maintenance CI wiring.

These tests do NOT spin up a self-hosted runner — they parse the workflow
YAML and assert the contract:

* The ``security-policy`` job downgrades ``is_fork`` to ``false`` for
  OWNER/MEMBER/COLLABORATOR authors on head != base PRs.
* The ``gpu-smoke`` job passes ``skip-atomic-age-trim: "true"`` when
  invoking the ``reclaim-runner-disk`` composite action.
* The daily ``runner-maintenance.yml`` job does NOT pass
  ``skip-atomic-age-trim``, so the full destructive trim still runs there.
